The BMI Calculator is a web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. This tool provides a simple, user-friendly interface to input weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters or centimeters) and then calculates the BMI using the formula:

Once the BMI is calculated, the tool classifies the result into different health categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on BMI ranges.

The application is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic that performs the calculation and displays the results dynamically without refreshing the page. It features a clean, responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The tool also includes error handling to ensure valid user inputs and provide clear feedback.
